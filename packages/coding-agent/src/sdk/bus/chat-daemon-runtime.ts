	 * The replay is fenced exactly like `attach()`: it is issued for the attachment's

	 * rebuild can re-fetch them. That round concedes them instead — loudly — carries
	 * the cursor over them, and publishes the suffix the host did keep, so the gap
	 * costs exactly the sequences the host lost and nothing that follows them. The
	 * concession is what moves the cursor, not the suffix: a host that kept every
	 * sequence above the gap can still answer with none of them, and a cursor left
	 * below the lost range would concede it again on every later replay. A gap is
	 * conceded only where it answers this round's own request: one that opens above
	 * the cursor, or that the same answer returns retained events from, states no
	 * bounded loss and is fenced like any other answer nothing can be concluded from.
	 * What the host evicted is not what delivery lost: a sequence in the conceded
