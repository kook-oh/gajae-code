# @bworx-io/worx-bridge-client

`@bworx-io/worx-bridge-client` is the standalone SDK v3 WebSocket transport client for Gajae Code. It exports `SdkClient`, `SdkClientError`, and the associated frame, request, reconnect, and options types.

```ts
import { SdkClient } from "@bworx-io/worx-bridge-client";

const client = await SdkClient.connect(endpoint.url, endpoint.token);
try {
	const metadata = await client.query("session.metadata");
	console.log(metadata);
} finally {
	await client.close();
}
```

## Transport contract

The client adds the endpoint token as a WebSocket query parameter, waits for a server `hello` frame before requests are sent, and correlates responses by request ID. A server error response rejects with `SdkClientError`, whose `code`, `message`, and `details` preserve the wire error. It bounds open, hello, retry, and request work with the configured timeout and optional absolute deadline.

A request that has been sent is never replayed after reconnect. Callers that need retry semantics must decide whether retrying their operation is safe and provide their own idempotency protocol where appropriate.

For a request timeout, `SdkClientError.details` is an `SdkRequestTimeoutDetails` object. `requestSent: true` means `WebSocket.send()` returned, not that the server accepted or completed the request. Treat it as execution uncertainty: do not resend an ordered `turn.prompt` or `skill.invoke`; retain a fresh `clientRef` before sending and query `turn.prompt_status` or `skill.invoke_status` with that reference.

## Scope and compatibility

This package is transport-only. It does not import, instantiate, dispatch to, or otherwise own `AgentSession`, broker lifecycle, backend process management, or application operation handlers.

It is SDK v3 only. The historical BridgeClient/backend-bridge protocol, RPC ingress, and compatibility behavior are intentionally unsupported and must not be restored. Use the documented SDK v3 WebSocket endpoint and frames instead.

`@bworx-io/worx-code/sdk` re-exports this package for compatibility; both entrypoints expose the same `SdkClient` class identity.

## Durable create, attach, and submit orchestration

`SdkClient.createConnectSubscribeSubmit()` is a durable client-side orchestration convenience operation over broker create and endpoint controls. It requires a fresh `createIdempotencyKey` and a fresh, kind-scoped 1–128 character `clientRef`. Its safe canonical recovery identity (`SdkDurableLookupIdentity`) carries no create replay material — no MCP server definitions, URLs, args, env, or headers — so no potentially secret-bearing field can leak into the public identity. The identity excludes credentials, secrets, submission payloads, and endpoint credentials.

The create key and submission reference are durably recorded by their existing respective authorities. There is no single-authority transactional atomicity guarantee across process failure: restart recovery uses `reconcileCreateConnectSubmit()` to resolve the composite outcome. The operation opens an operation-owned endpoint socket, completes same-incarnation replay on that socket, then writes at most one `turn.prompt` or `skill.invoke`. Ordered work is never retried. A transport failure after the write returns `submission_uncertain`, not a successful or non-executed result.

Use `reconcileCreateConnectSubmit(identity, options)` for recovery. When the identity has no `sessionId`, supply the original `create` via `options.create` so the broker's idempotency key can resolve the prior create; the create is never stored on or serialized through the identity. The method queries the matching prompt or skill status, but never sends an ordered control. `unknown` means the reconciliation authority or retention cannot establish the outcome; it is not proof that the work did not execute.
